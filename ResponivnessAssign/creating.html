            Rhythm games are more of a timing synced beat the user needs to stick with to complete the level. Synced to the music and timing to click or
            tap the screen as well as holding left click on the mouse or holding on the screen to fly or things like that. A game to talk about when it 
            comes to this is Geometry Dash, a mobile and PC game on both Steam and Google Play (Google is trying to take it down though)

                Geometry Dash is a video game where players need to fly, switch gravities, and jump their way through spikes, blocks, and monsters to not 
                crash in the level they are playing, either it is from the creator of Geometry Dash or not. When I say that it isn't always from the 
                creator of the game, Robtop, I mean it. There are online levels to play and run trough as well. As long as players doesn't get the Lite 
                Version (Demo) of Geometry Dash, players are allowed to get different skins, colors, trails, and death effects. There is also more secrets
                in the full version of Geometry Dash that only costs about 3 dollars. This level is called Theory Of Everything or in short, ToE.

            I also have never mention the difficulty ratings shown by the face next to the level. Theory of Everythiing is a insane rating meaning it is 
            very hard to try and complete the level but not too impossible. During Geoemtry Dash's earlier days, Insane was seen as the hardest difficulty 
            and a few levels that once was rated insane is now rated harder. But later on, a new difficulty would be created. This difficulty give the most
            rewards and viewed more harder than a insane rating. This was the next step up with levels being made then to now.

                    These fours levels are the top five hardest levels that has ever existed in Geometry Dash. I give my thanks to Smekler for giving this data 
                    in Steam Community on January 21st, 2023. Only one problem, the level in second place held its spot in the hardest demon level for a year 
                    and it has already past september. On October 16th, 2023, a level made by <b>PockeWindfish</b> came on top. Acheron has been surpassed by a very 
                    unpopular level named Avernus. People now showing hate and mixed feelings towards the level for the way it was designed and the creators 
                    promising it will be an enjoyable level. The controversy between this level is massive in the Geometry Dash community that people may have 
                    possibly tried to create their own demon list (if they actually did, don't take my word as truth. Most likely wrong). Little extra info, 
                    levels that are extreme demon rated are recorded in the demon list (Main, Extended, and Legacy lists) and Avernus is set in the peak of 
                    the Main List. Yes, Demons were once just a singular rating as demon and nothing else until update 2.1 or 2.0 where Demons were set into 
                    5 different parts. Easy Demon, Medium Demon, Hard Demon, Insane Demon, and the hardest being Extreme Demon.

        <p class="conclusion">
            Geometry Dash is a wonderful game for making levels, creating the hardest ones to challenge players to go pass their limits. 
            Even challenging the creators themselves to suprass them too. It's like a website, requiring the layout out, then some 
            commands, then some stylings. Thank you for coming on this website about Geometry Dash, have a good day!
